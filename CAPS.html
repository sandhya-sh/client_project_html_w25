            <p>University Health & Counseling (UHC) supports the health and well-being of the campus community. We are
                inspired to help students realize their potential, cope with the stresses of life, work productively,
                and connect meaningfully with others.

                UHC is made up of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), which offers counseling services, and
                University Health Service (UHS), which offers medical services. This website is about CAPS. For
                information about UHS, please visit the UHS website.

                CAPS is committed to creating an environment based on our values of multicultural, multi-disciplinary
                and multi-theoretical practices that allow our diverse student body to access care, receive high quality
                services and take positive pathways to mental health. We are happy to offer both in-person and virtual
                services.

                Our Front Desk (Michigan Union 4th Floor) is open and ready to help support you -- staff members are
                available throughout the day to assist you with your needs to answer questions, and get you to the right
                place. We can be reached by phone at: (734) 764-8312.

                CAPS has a limited number of private spaces available for students to connect with their counselor via
                telecounseling. Please contact the front desk for more information on those private spaces.

                Please Note: During high-demand periods, CAPS will be unable to accommodate class-related interviews
                and/or projects. Many students are able to find the information they need within our website and our
                annual reports.

                The CAPS office is unable to participate in scavenger hunts for students due to maintaining the
                confidentiality of our clients. However, you are welcome to direct students to the wellness zone, which
                has a separate entrance adjacent to CAPS. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.

                <h2>A Brief Note of Support Regarding the Violence in Israel and Gaza
                </h2>
                <p>CAPS extends its support to all our students who are being impacted by the current violence in Israel
                    and Gaza. We recognize the understandable grief, fear and anger that many of our students may be
                    experiencing right now, especially our students who are Israeli, Palestinian, or have ties to or
                    loved ones in those regions. We encourage all of you to take care of and be compassionate with
                    yourselves and each other; it is in times like these, that we can come together as a community, and
                    in fact, we need to.</p>

                <h2>Self-Care For Incidents Of Campus Climate Concerns
                </h2>
                <p>When faced with social injustices and bias incidents, it is extremely difficult to cope and know what
                    to do. Feeling overwhelmed with the current socio-political state, experiencing discrimination, or
                    being impacted by contentious people or policies increases stress which remains correlated to
                    negative mental health outcomes. During these times, it remains imperative that we take care of
                    ourselves, take care of loved ones, and take care of our campus community. We all have the power to
                    spread kindness, celebrate diversity and inclusion, and promote social justice.</p>
